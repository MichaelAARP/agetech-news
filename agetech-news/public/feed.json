By analyzing the data, patients and physicians can get insights to help determine changes in health and the efficacy of treatments. The seat includes three sensors: an electrocardiogram, a photoplethysmogram and a ballistocardiogram. Each of these sensors help identify vital signals such as heart rate, blood pressure and blood oxygenation.

    "content": "As part of a pilot program last year involving radar-based technology maker Xandar Kardian, contactless monitoring sensors were installed in a skilled nursing facility in New York. The facility monitored residents’ vital signs continuously using in-room XK300 devices, including during sleep. Data analysis showed that an elevated resting heart rate could predict an upcoming medical crisis, even when a resident’s respiratory rate was stable. In the case of one resident, Xandar Kardian’s sensors detected multiple sustained elevations of resting heart rate in the week before her cardiac arrest. Subsequent analysis suggested that care providers could in the future combine the data collected on resting heart rate and respiratory rate to detect the need for intervention within the first six hours of respiratory rate deterioration.",
